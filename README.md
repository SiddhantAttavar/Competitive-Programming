# Competitive-Programming
A repository where I store all my competitive programming related code. This includes my practice for informatics olympiads (ZCO, INOI, IOITC), competitive programming contests (CodeChef, Codeforces), practice problem sets (CSES), interschool contests and more.

## Stucture: <a name = "structure"></a>
 - Algorithms: Some practice problems for me to understand various algorithms
 - CSES Problem Set: my solutions of problems from cses
 - Codebreaker_Dunjudge: solutions from [Codebreaker](https://codebreaker.xyz/) and [Dunjudge](https://dunjudge.me/) problems
 - CodeChef Contests: solutions from [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/) contests I have participated in
 - Codeforces Contests: solutions from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) contests I have participated in
 - DSA Learning Series: Some problems I have attempted from CodeChef's [DSA Learning Series](https://www.codechef.com/LEARNDSA/)
 - Data Structures: A list (cheat sheet?) of some of data structures I have learned
 - ICO: Preparation for various stages of the [Indian Computing Olympiad](https://www.iarcs.org.in/inoi/)
	- IACRS Sample Problems: my solutions for [IARCS OPC Judge Problems](https://www.codechef.com/IARCSJUD)
	- ICO20MCK: a [mock ZCO contest](https://www.codechef.com/ICO20MCK)
	- INOI Past Problems: my solutions for [past INOI problems](https://www.codechef.com/INOIPRAC/)
	- IOITC 2021: problems and solutions from IOITC 2021 TSTs and mock TSTs

	- UFDS 2022: my solutions from mock contests and practice problems during the [UFDS Mentoring Program 2022](https://ufds.cc/)
	- Other: other practice problems
 - Scripts: Scripts that I have created to help create new solution files where [Competitive Companion](https://www.google.com/search?q=competitive+companion&oq=competitive+companion&aqs=edge..69i57j0i512l5j69i64.4565j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) is not supported
 - Syntax: Some programs I created while learning C++ and Java
 - Templates: My Python, C++, and Java competitive programming templates
 - Theory: Some more algorithms I have learnt (mostly during IOITC)
 - build: A collection of test cases for the various problems to be used with the [Competitive Programming Helper extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DivyanshuAgrawal.competitive-programming-helper) for Visual Studio Code
 - Other Contests: Other contests I have participated in (mostly interschool contests and [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/))
 - Other Problems: practice problems that I couldn't classify elsewhere
